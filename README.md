## Skills
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning:** Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn

## Projects
- [**Churn Prediction for Telecom Operator**](https://github.com/claireaung/Data_Projects_Triple_Ten/tree/main/Telecom_customer_churn): Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn using CatBoost, with an AUC-ROC of 0.95.
- [**Video Game Sales Analysis**](https://github.com/claireaung/Data_Projects_Triple_Ten/tree/main/ICE%20online%20game): Analyzed global video game sales data to assess future trends and developed predictive models based on platform and genre.
- [**Rusty Bargain Used Car Sales**](https://github.com/claireaung/Data_Projects_Triple_Ten/tree/main/Rusty_bargain_used_car_sales) : Developed machine learning models (Random Forest, LightGBM) to predict used car prices based on historical data like technical specifications and sales records. Models were optimized using RMSE for accurate price prediction.
- [**Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis**](https://github.com/claireaung/Data_Projects_Triple_Ten/tree/main/instacart): Analyzed customer shopping habits using Instacart's dataset, handling missing and duplicate values. Visualized order patterns, peak shopping times, and frequently purchased products to provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.
- [**Movie Review Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/claireaung/Data_Projects_Triple_Ten/tree/main/flim_junky): Built a sentiment analysis model using IMDB movie reviews to classify positive and negative reviews. Explored logistic regression and gradient boosting models, achieving the target F1 score for accurate review classification.
- [**Gold Recovery Prediction**](https://github.com/claireaung/Data_Projects_Triple_Ten/tree/main/gold): Created models to predict gold recovery rates in mining operations using historical data. Analyzed metal concentration changes at different stages of purification and optimized models with sMAPE for accurate performance.
